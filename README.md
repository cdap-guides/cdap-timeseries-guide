Storing Timeseries Data
=======================

The Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) provides a number of pre-packaged Datasets, which make
it easy to store and retrieve data using best-practices based implementations of common data
access patterns.  This application demonstrates how to process and store timeseries data, using
the example of real-time sensor data from a traffic monitor network.
